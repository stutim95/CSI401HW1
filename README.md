# CSI402HW1
A project done for ICSI402(Systems Programming) at University at Albany in Fall 2015. 
<br>
The homework is as follows:<br>
<p>
In this homework you are going to create a SIC assembler (simulator) using C. The assembler has to do the following:
1.	Interpret a given assembly code given in a text file
2.	Calculate LC values 
3.	Create symbol table
4.	Create an object file which contains the op-code for the program	</p>
<p>
The src files have the following functions:
<b>main.c : </b> The main file
<b>lc.c : </b> The LC table
<b>object_code.c : </b>Calculates the object code and adds them to an output file
<b>readopcodes.c : </b>Reads the opcodes from an input file
<b>symbols.c : </b>Contains the functions for the binary tree
</p>
